This is a project involving in the application of neural network on real-world classification problems, which includes two main objectives. 

The first objective is to apply data mining techniques on the given two datasets, which contain information and features of the confirmed or potential COVID-19 infected, and try to distinguish how likely an individual is infected given certain features. The expected result will be that given new features of uncertain infection, this program (based on python3) is supposed to output a credible binary prediction on if an individual is infected or not. Specifically, an 1 will be regarded as infected and a 0 will not.

The other objective is to compare and evaluate the model performance of neural network with different structure and combination of parameters. Specifically, the variables include the amount of hidden layers, the amount of neurons in each layer, the choice of activation function, loss function, optimizer, the percentage of validation set, the number of epochs and batch size.
